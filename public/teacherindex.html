              to complete their homework at earlier times, therefore allowing them to get more sleep.<br><br> One of the major problems in stress inducers for adolescents
                in our school is finishing their homework. Unfortunately, when we took a survey which examined 50 seventh graders sleepschedules, we found that 94% of 
                that sample got less than the recommended amount of sleep. To clarify, only three students out of 50 got at least nine hours and 15 minutes of 
                sleep on an average school night. <br><br>Our website hopes to solve this problem by having students complete their homework earlier in the day. We plan 
                to accomplish this by incentivizing students using a point based system with various rewards.<br><br><strong>H</strong>³ was created by four seventh grade girls living in Connecticut that felt the first hand effects
                of sleep deprivation due to working late into the night on homework. For an invention contest, they decided to create this website in hope of helping kids around the world
                to combat this issue.<br><br>We hope you benefit from <strong>H</strong>³ and spread the words to your peers about how homework can be managed.<br><br>
